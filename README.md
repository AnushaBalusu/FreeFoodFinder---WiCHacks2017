This app was originally developed in WiCHacks 2017 by me and 3 other fellow mates. The original project which was developed in 24 hours can be found on http://52.37.125.146/

The current project is my extension of the original project and I plan to add more features to it.

This is a webapp which helps to post and find free food on RIT campus.
